<h5>PAUL RAND: DEFINING DESIGN</h5>

<p>American designer Paul Rand (1914 – 1996) defined design as a unified activity, based on analysis and governed by imagination. Throughout his lengthy career – in which he created some of world’s most successful and recognizable logos such as those for IBM, Westinghouse, UPS, and ABC – his design work was governed by fundamental principles that he identified in his writings, such as beauty, intelligence, repetition, symbol, and humor. Today, designers across the world derive influence and inspiration from Rand’s body of work, acknowledging that he set new standards for graphic design. <br> <br>
Paul Rand: Defining Design will examine the trajectory of Rand’s career in an entirely new way, juxtaposing his iconic designs with discussion of the design principles by which they were informed. In addition, short films, interviews, and examples of Rand’s persuasive writings will further illuminate this legendary designer’s thoughts on the design process.</p> </div> </div>

<h5>MINI-EXHIBITION - MISSION: ALPHA CENTARI</h5>

<p>From October 27 to January 26, MODA’s Design Bar will house a mini exhibition titled, “Mission: Alpha Centauri.” The exhibition spotlights the work of first year graduate students in Georgia Tech’ School of Architecture, who were charged with solving a design problem of the future: <br> <br>

Following a catastrophic world war in the late 22nd century, Earth becomes largely uninhabitable. The remaining nations form an alliance to save mankind by seeking other habitable planets around Alpha Centauri, the closest solar system to our Sun. In order to carry out this research, however, they need self-sustaining spaceships with renewable energy sources that can carry the fleet throughout the universe. <br> <br>

Georgia Tech students took on the task of creating design concepts for these spaceships. Come study the results of their project and participate in the creative process yourself!</p> </div>
