<div id="text" class="fluid"> <p> The mission of the Museum of Design Atlanta (MODA) articulates the organization’s commitment to advancing the understanding and appreciation of design as the convergence of creativity and functionality through educational programs. In order to fulfill our mission, we offer a variety of educational programs for students, ages 6-18, and for educators. <br> <br>

As the only design museum in the southeastern United States, MODA’s educational priority is that of raising local and regional awareness of design as a methodology for solving problems and discovering opportunities. We do this by offering in-museum and out-of-museum programs in which adults and children engage in the powerful, comprehensive, and creative process that is design thinking. <br> <br> </p>

<div id="text" class="fluid"> <p> Want your child to do something unique and absolutely cool? <br> <br>

How about building and designing robots using LEGOs? <br> <br>

At campMODA, students 6-14 years old learn basic robotic
 engineering, programming principals, and science, technology, engineering and math concepts while having fun! <br> <br>

Your child’s natural curiosity and ingenuity will help them 
envision possibilities and develop innovative solutions to 
difficult technology problems.</p>

<div id="text" class="fluid"> <p> Design is everywhere.  From the buildings we work and live in to the graphic messages that allow us to share information and from the way we interact with our computers to the clothes we wear: design pervades our lives. <br> <br>

As the only museum in the Southeast dedicated exclusively to design, MODA’s mission is to explore the many facets of the design disciplines–architecture; electronic media; fashion; 
furniture; graphic, industrial, and interior design to name a few–as they exert a positive influence on Atlanta and the Southeast.</p>
